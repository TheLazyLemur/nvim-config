## Nvim Config


I wanted to use Neovim for most, if not all of my work.
So I set out to create a Neovim config file that would be able to fill most of my
essentail needs when it comes to a Code Editing environment. This setup ultimatley allows my
workflow to stay consistant acrros what ever project/language I am working on with no configuration
gotchas.
